## 🚀 What is PegaProx?

PegaProx is a powerful web-based management interface for Proxmox VE and XCP-ng clusters. Manage multiple clusters from a single dashboard with features like live monitoring, VM management, automated tasks, and more.

</p>

### 🪽 What's in the name?

The name **PegaProx** is inspired by *Pegasus*, the winged horse of Greek mythology, combined with *Prox* as a reference to Proxmox VE. Pegasus symbolises speed, freedom and elegant flight — qualities we aspire to bring to multi-cluster hypervisor management.

- 👥 **Multi-User Support** - Role-based access control (Admin, Operator, Viewer) + custom roles
- 🛠️ **API Token Management** - Create, list, and revoke Bearer tokens (scoped per role)
- 🔐 **2FA Authentication** - TOTP-based two-factor authentication (with force option)
- 🔑 **WebAuthn / FIDO2** - Hardware-key login (YubiKey, Nitrokey, Touch ID, Windows Hello) — passwordless or as 2FA factor

- 🚑 **Site Recovery** - Configure DR plans (boot order, dependencies, replication mappings) and execute controlled failover with audit trail.
- 📦 **Backup SLA Tracking** - SLA dashboard per cluster + datastore: last-backup age vs configured RPO, integrated with the Alert pipeline.

## ⚡ Quick Start / Installation

### Automated Installation
This installation method pulls the deployment script directly from the current HEAD of the main branch. This means you will always receive the latest available version, including the most recent features and improvements. However, because it is not tied to a specific release, it may also contain unreleased changes or bugs that have not yet been fully tested. If you prefer a stable and tested version, consider installing PegaProx from a tagged release instead.

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PegaProx/project-pegaprox/refs/heads/main/deploy.sh
chmod +x deploy.sh
sudo ./deploy.sh
```

### Debian Repository
This installation method uses the official APT repository provided by gyptazy. The repository and its associated build and packaging pipeline are fully hosted and maintained by <a href="https://github.com/gyptazy">gyptazy</a>, where PegaProx releases are automatically built and published as Debian packages. Unlike the automated installation script, which pulls the latest code directly from the repository branch, the APT repository distributes packaged and versioned releases. This generally provides a more stable and predictable installation, making it the recommended approach for production environments.
```bash
curl https://git.gyptazy.com/api/packages/gyptazy/debian/repository.key -o /etc/apt/keyrings/gyptazy.asc
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/gyptazy.asc] https://packages.gyptazy.com/api/packages/gyptazy/debian trixie main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gyptazy.list
apt-get update

apt-get -y install pegaprox
```

## Installation from Source
This installation methods run PegaProx directly from the source code repository. It is primarily intended for development, testing, or advanced users who want full control over the codebase or want to modify and extend the project.

By default, cloning the repository will pull the latest state of the main branch, which contains the most recent changes and features. While this ensures you always have the newest code available, it may also include in-progress changes that are not part of an official release yet.
If you prefer a more stable version, you can optionally checkout a specific release tag from the repository before installing dependencies and starting the application. This allows you to run the exact code corresponding to an official release while still using the source-based installation method.

Running PegaProx from source can be useful for debugging, contributing to the project, or integrating custom functionality, since you have direct access to the entire codebase and can easily update it using standard Git workflows.

### Manual Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PegaProx/project-pegaprox.git
cd project-pegaprox
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 pegaprox_multi_cluster.py

## 🔒 Security

- **Database at rest** → SQLCipher (AES-256-CBC + HMAC-SHA512, SQLCipher format v4) on Linux x86_64. Plain SQLite + per-field Fernet on other platforms (ARM / macOS / Windows). See [`docs/SECURITY.md`](docs/SECURITY.md) for the threat model and recovery story.
- **Master key custody** → Multi-tier loader: `PEGAPROX_DB_KEY` env / systemd `LoadCredentialEncrypted` (TPM2-bound) / `/etc/pegaprox/secret.key` / `~/.config/pegaprox/secret.key` / legacy `config/`. Default chmod 0600, files with loose permissions are skipped rather than used silently.
- **Sensitive fields** (Cluster PW, SSH keys, TOTP secrets, OIDC client secrets, LDAP bind) → Fernet (AES-256-GCM equivalent), works even when full-DB encryption isn't available.
- **API Tokens** → SHA-256 hash (constant-time compare).
- **Passwords** → Argon2id (3 iter, 64 MB memory cost).
- HTTPS required for production.
- Session tokens expire after inactivity; optional strict-IP binding.
- Per-IP rate limiting on login + every authenticated endpoint.
- Input sanitization, CSRF Origin matching, RBAC enforced server-side on every route.
- Auto-encryption on first boot — operators can opt out with `PEGAPROX_DISABLE_AUTO_ENCRYPT=1` if they want to take their own pre-encryption backup first.
