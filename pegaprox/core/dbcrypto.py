"""
DB connection abstraction with optional SQLCipher full-DB encryption.

Why this module exists
----------------------
PegaProx 0.9.9.x encrypted *individual sensitive fields* (passwords, SSH keys,
TOTP secrets) with Fernet inside an otherwise plain SQLite database.  That
left a lot of operational data in cleartext: hostnames, audit metadata,
session tokens, plugin state.  A leaked DB backup gave an attacker enough
context to plan a follow-up attack — even without the secret.key.

This module adds a transparent SQLCipher backend.  When sqlcipher3 is
importable (Linux x86_64 via pip wheel today), every PegaProx DB connection
is automatically AES-256-CBC + HMAC-SHA512 encrypted at rest using the
master key resolved by `pegaprox.core.keystore`.

When sqlcipher3 is NOT importable (ARM, macOS, Windows — until they ship
wheels), we fall back to plain sqlite3.  In that case the existing
field-level encryption + the new Multi-Tier key-location protection still
apply — graceful degradation.

The public API is `connect(db_path)` — one entry point, all callers use it.

# plaintext page bytes don't get paged to swap. mlock(2) needs either root,
# CAP_IPC_LOCK, or a fat RLIMIT_MEMLOCK — none of which apply to a default
# non-root container in k3s, so the lock fails with ENOMEM on every open
# and SQLCipher emits a WARN line. Over ~2 connections/sec that drowns the
# log. The at-rest encryption is unaffected; only the in-memory page cache
# protection goes away.

#   PEGAPROX_CIPHER_MEMORY_SECURITY=on       force the PRAGMA on (bare-metal)

# ─── Off-hub heavy reads (scaling) ───────────────────────────────────────────
# NS 2026-06-04 — measured scaling fix for large fleets (#526/#528 class).
# PegaProx runs on a single gevent hub thread: every greenlet (all per-cluster
# poll/balance loops + the WSGI request handlers) cooperatively shares ONE OS
# thread. A sqlite3/SQLCipher query is a C call that does NOT yield to gevent,
# so a heavy read freezes the ENTIRE hub for its full duration — measured at
# ~0.65s for a 30-day metrics_history scan on a 4-cluster dev box (the hub
# ticked 0 times during it), scaling linearly with cluster count (~5s+ at 10
# clusters). That stall is the lag/freeze big deployments hit when someone
# opens Insights / Cost / Power views.
#
# run_heavy_read runs the query on a FRESH, independent connection inside
# gevent's OS threadpool. SQLCipher releases the GIL during its work, so the
# hub thread keeps scheduling every other greenlet while the query runs in a
# worker thread (measured: hub ticked 62x during the same 0.65s query when
# offloaded — i.e. stayed fully responsive). Fresh-connection-per-call is
# deliberate: the connection is opened, used, and closed entirely within the
# one worker thread, so there is never cross-thread use of a shared sqlite
# connection (unsafe even with check_same_thread=False). WAL mode (already on)
# means this read connection doesn't lock-contend with the main writer.
